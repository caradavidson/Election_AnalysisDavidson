# Election_AnalysisDavidson
I completed an election audit for the Colorado Board of Elections. I specifically worked on:
-Calculating the total number of votes.
-Got a complete list of the candidates who receieved votes.
-Calculated the total number of votes each candidate received.
-Calculated the percentage of votes each candidate won.
-Found out the winner of the election, based on vote popularity.
